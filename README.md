# extinction_stability_fr_simulations
a numerical simulation comparing trait stability, as determined by extinction simulations, to functional redundancy

The Rscript creates n trait contribution distributions using a lognormal distribution with ranodm community richness and evenness parameter (a). Simulations randomly select species to undergo extinction until a propotion of an ecosystem function is lost.
